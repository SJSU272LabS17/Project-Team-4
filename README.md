# Project-Team-4 Project - 1 Smart Helmet = APPROVED
Abstract: Internet revolutionized our entire view with the help of IOT (Internet of things). As we all know Motor Cycle is one of the common and fastest transportation to our destination, due to this many casualties occur every year so we have come up with an idea where if a driver meets with an accident, the location of the driver will be sent to the emergency contacts so proper medical care will be taken which reduces the number of casualties by 3 times. Smart Helmet is the idea we have come up with
Smart Helmet is implemented using GSM and GPS technology. The working of a Smart Helmet is also easy where we will place various vibrating sensors on the helmet which are connected to a micro controller. So when the rider crashes and hits the ground the sensors will provide this information to Microcontroller. The Microcontroller extracts GPS data using GPS model which then automatically sends an SMS to emergency contacts provided.

Theft Detection at ATMs using IOT

Despite the introduction of cashless payments, people withdraw cash from the ATMs and deposit a lot of cash at ATMs. This gives rise to opportunities for burglars for an armed burglary at these places often hurting people and damaging property. 

To reduce these, we propose a system that continuously monitors the surroundings of the ATM for sudden movements or any weapons. If there is any sudden movement near the ATM or movement of another person behind the person using ATM, the entire video and snapshots of the incident would be sent to the emergency contacts and law officials and an alarm would be triggered automatically. These pictures could further be used in recognition of faces and their identification for stopping future burglaries.

This is done using IOT devices and Pattern Detection Algorithms to detect motion and take snapshots automatically when sudden movement occur and alert emergency contacts.

How engaged my employees are?

Employee engagement is a property of the relationship between an organization and its employees. Engaged employee is generally fully absorbed by and enthusiastic about their work and so takes positive action to further the organization's reputation and interests.

This project aims at tracking the engagement of employees by mining and analyzing employee's social media interactions such as tweets, posts and generating score from the vocabulary used in those posts.
