# Project-Team-4 Project - 1 Smart Helmet = APPROVED
Abstract: Internet revolutionized our entire view with the help of IOT (Internet of things). As we all know Motor Cycle is one of the common and fastest transportation to our destination, due to this many casualties occur every year so we have come up with an idea where if a driver meets with an accident, the location of the driver will be sent to the emergency contacts so proper medical care will be taken which reduces the number of casualties by 3 times. Smart Helmet is the idea we have come up with
Smart Helmet is implemented using GSM and GPS technology. The working of a Smart Helmet is also easy where we will place various vibrating sensors on the helmet which are connected to a micro controller. So when the rider crashes and hits the ground the sensors will provide this information to Microcontroller. The Microcontroller extracts GPS data using GPS model which then automatically sends an SMS to emergency contacts provided.
 
 An Additional functionality of calling an emergency contact during the accident has been implemented. The GSM library files has been fed to the micro controller, where in as soon as the free cal is detected a voice call will be triggered.
  Future enhancements can be made by integrating a mic into the helmet and AI can be implemented to perform more functionals like calling a specific person, leaving an audio note etc., on giving commands using a BitVoicer app.
