Theft Detection at ATMs using IOT

Despite the introduction of cashless payments, people withdraw cash from the ATMs and deposit a lot of cash at ATMs. This gives rise to opportunities for burglars for an armed burglary at these places often hurting people and damaging property. 

To reduce these, we propose a system that continuously monitors the surroundings of the ATM for sudden movements or any weapons. If there is any sudden movement near the ATM or movement of another person behind the person using ATM, the entire video and snapshots of the incident would be sent to the emergency contacts and law officials and an alarm would be triggered automatically. These pictures could further be used in recognition of faces and their identification for stopping future burglaries.

This is done using IOT devices and Pattern Detection Algorithms to detect motion and take snapshots automatically when sudden movement occur and alert emergency contacts.
